## About the Solution

The project uses **OpenTelemetry** for collecting and merging observability signals, facilitating anomaly and failure detection in microservices. A library was developed that applies **Annotations** to monitor specific metrics during service execution.

This approach led to the creation of the **FOCUS** solution (Data **F**usion of **O**bservability signals to dete**C**t anomalies and fail**U**res in microservice**S**), which retrieves instrumented data and sends it to a dedicated **dashboard**. 
This dashboard provides valuable insights into the system, enabling a comprehensive analysis of **metrics** and **distributed tracing**. For a better understanding of the solution, refer to
